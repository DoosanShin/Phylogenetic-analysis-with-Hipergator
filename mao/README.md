The command-line interface requires a special input file called a MEGA Analysis Options (.mao) file which specifies the analysis to run as well as the analysis options to use. This .mao file can only be created by using the GUI interface.

#Generating the MEGA Analysis Options File
On the main MEGA window, click the Prototype button, which is near the bottom right corner of the window, to switch MEGA to the prototyping mode. A dialog will be shown that prompts for the data type to be used. In this
dialog, select Nucleotide and click OK.
Select Phylogeny | Construct/Test Neighbor-Joining Tree from the main MEGA windows launch bar.
The Analysis Preferences window will be shown. We will use the default options so in this dialog, just click the Save Settings button.
When prompted to save the .mao file, navigate to your Documents\MEGA X\Examples folder and save the file as infer_NJ_nucleotide.mao.
Close MEGA X.
